# Changelog

## v0.2

### Changes

* `action` attribute in the template tags was changed to `insert` to avoid
conflicts with form attributes.  This is not backwards compatible.

* Changed the name of the file in the template tag from `a.py` to
`tentacles.py`. `{% load a %}` is deprecated.  Change it to
`{% load tentacles %}`


### New Features

* Create-, Update-, and DeleteViews support added and tested.

* New template tag to create forms

* Added `self` to allowed `insert` methods.  This is similar to `replace` but
in case several nodes have been appended or prepended, it only replaces the
exact node in question rather than overwriting the contents of the entire
`target`.  This allows for creating, editing, or deleting multiple models in
place and saving them individually. If `insert="self"` is set, `target` is
ignored.

 ArchiveIndexView, DayArchiveView, TodayArchiveView, DateDetailView,

* A template tag to generate octopus-compatible links
