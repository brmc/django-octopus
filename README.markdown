## Quick start ##

1\. `pip install git+git://github.com/brmc/django-octopus.git`

2\. `settings.py`

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'octopus',
        ...
   )
You may need to restart your development server to detect the template tags.  

3\. Add javascript:

    \<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js" type="text/javascript">
    \</script>
    \<script src="{% static 'octopus/both.js' %}" type="text/javascript">\</script>

4\. Define your views:

    from octopus.views import OctopusDetailView, OctopusListView

    def YourDetailView(OctopusDetailView):
        model = YourModel
        template_name = "<template name>"
        fragment_name = "<template fragment name>"

    def YourListView(OctopusListView):
        model = YourModel
        template_name = "<template name>"
        fragment_name = "<template fragment name>"

where `template_name` is the name of a fully rendered template and
`fragment_name` is a stripped down template.  It's recommended to simply
import `fragment_name` into `template_name`.

See [Usage](#views) for more detail information on using generic views or on  
writing your own functional views.

5\. Create your links.  Manually, :

    <a href="{% url 'detail' object.id %}" class="octopus-link"
    target="#container" action="replace" method="get" title="New title">Link 
    Text</a>

or or with a template tag

    {% a 'Link Text' '#container' 'detail' object.id action="replace" method="get" title="New title %}

6\. Putting it all together, a template might look like [this](#creating-templates)


See [Usage](#template-tags) for details on optional and default parameters.

## Changelog (Recent Changes)

### v0.1

#### Features

* New generic class-based views that correspond to DetailView, ListView,  
 ArchiveIndexView, DayArchiveView, TodayArchiveView, DateDetailView, 
 WeekArchiveView, MonthArchiveView, and YearArchiveView
 
* A mixin(AjaxResponseMixin) to be used on pre-existing CBVs

* A template tag to generate octopus-compatible links

## Requirements ##

1. Python 2.7, 3.3, or 3.4

2. Django, v1.5+

3. jQuery (Tested with 1.11 but probably works with any recent version that 
 supports deferred.done, deferred.fail, and deferred.always methods)

## How does it work?

Special links are created using a template tag that are intercepted when 
clicked by a simple jQuery script and routed via AJAX to views that are 
defined to conditionally render a full template when one navigates 
directly to a URL(or if javascript is unavailable) or to render a specific 
portion of the template if requested via AJAX(will be made more descriminating 
later).  The HTML returned by the server is then inserted into a node in the 
DOM specified by a link attribute. Browser states are updated to preserve full 
back/forward functionality.

## Installation ##

1\. install octopus:

    pip install django-octopus
    
2\. Add to INSTALLED_APPS:

    settings.py
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'octopus'
    )
    
3\. Include the appropriate javascript to your templates, depending on the 
  following scenarios:

  A.  Make sure you have jQuery included before the `octopus` JS files.  If 
  you're lazy, here's a quick link for you:
  
    <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

  B.  If you need CSRF protection(i.e., for a POST request), include `ajax.js`

    <script src="{% static 'octopus/ajax.js' %}" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
  This is just the JS pulled directly from djangoproject.com:    
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/csrf/#ajax  
  so feel free to write your own.  There's nothing special about it.
  
  C.  Include `octopux.js`
  
    <script src="{% static 'octopus/octopus.js' %}" type="text/javascript"></script>
    

  D.  If you need both, you can skip B and C and just include `both.js`
  
    <script src="{% static 'octopus/both.js' %}" type="text/javascript"></script>
    

## Usage ##

There's just two steps:

1. Create your views

2. Create your links (with or without the template tag)

### Views ###

#### Creating Class-Based Views ####

Generic views have been created for the detail, list, and time-based views  
following the naming convention of Octopus<OriginalViewName>.  If that doesn't 
make sense, here's an explicit list of the available views with their 
respective counter parts:

| Octopus View            |      Django View |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| OctopusDetailView       | DetailView       |
| OctopusListView         | ListView         |
| OctopusArchiveIndexView | ArchiveIndexView |
| OctopusDayArchiveView   | DayArchiveView   |
| OctopusTodayArchiveView | TodayArchiveView |
| OctopusDateDetailView   | DateDetailView   |
| OctopusWeekArchiveView  | WeekArchiveView  |
| OctopusMonthArchiveView | MonthArchiveView |
| OctopusYearArchiveView  | YearArchiveView  |

You use these just as you would the normal CBV's.  The only difference is that 
You also need to define a `fragment_name` in addition to the `template_name` 

    from octopus.views import OctopusDetailView
    from yourapp.models import YouModel
    
    class YourDetailView(OctopusDetailView):
        model = YourModel
        template_name = "puzzle.html"
        fragment_name = "puzzlepiece.html"
        
But if you don't feel like defining the fragment names, just like 
`template_suffix`, a `fragment_suffix` of `'_fragment` has been provided.  So 
you can just name your templates accordingly.  But note, the `fragment_suffix` 
is appened **after** the `template_suffix`, so if your full template was called 

    yourapp/yourmodel_detail.html
    
then your fragment template should be called

    yourapp/yourmodel_detail_fragment.html


No other methods are enabled by default besides GET, so you will still have 
to define any other methods you need.


#### Creating Function-Based Views

The only caveat is to wrap your template definition in an `is_ajax()` method:

    def your_vew(request, *args, **kwargs):
        ...
        if request.is_ajax():
            template = "template_fragment.html"
        else:
            template = "full_template.html"
        ...


#### Using the AjaxResponseMixin with existing views ####

**this is untested**

This should work if you explicitly set your `template_name` and `fragment_name`, 
but like I said, I haven't tested this.  I just thought about mentioning it at 
the last minute, so proceed at your own risk.

    from octopus.views import AjaxResponseMixin 
    
    class YourView(AjaxResponseMixin, YourCustomBaseView):
        ...
        template_name = "weeewoo.html"
        fragment_name = "weeedoo_fragment.html"
        ...
        

### Template Tags ###

The order for the template tags are: 

Link text, target element, url name, url arguments, kwargs.

* **Link Text**: the visible, clickable text for the link.
 
* **Target Element**: the html node that will receive the rendered template 
returned from the ajax request. E.g., `main`, `#container`, `.container`

* **URL name**: the name of the url as defined in your urlconfs to be 
passed to reverse().  If settings.OCTOPUS_ALLOW_MANUAL is set to True, you may 
pass a hard-coded url.

* **URL arguments** are as many parameters you wish/need to pass to reverse
 
* **Kwargs**:
    * **method**: the HTTP Method with which you wish to make the ajax request. 
    **Default** `get`
    
    * **action**: `replace`, `prepend`, `append`  
    **Default** `replace`
    
    * **classes**: a string of class names.  **pass the names, rather than the 
    selectors**: i.e., "class1, class2" rather than ".class1, .class2" 
    **Default**: None
    
    * **id**: like above but for the Id.
    **Default**: None

    * **title**: Text for the <title> node.
    **Default**: None
 
### Manually Create Links

The template tag only creates standard inline text links.  If you want to  
create a link on an image or need some extra data attributes, you will have to 
build the links yourself.

But it's not hard. The only required attributes are:

* href="..."

* target="..."

* class="octopus-link ..."

Then you can pass the kwargs as defined in [Template Tags](#template-tags)


### Creating templates ###

A very basic template schema might look something like this:

Full template:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% a 'click me' 'main' 'list' %}
        <main>
            {% include "template_fragment.html" %}
        </main>
        ...
        <!--javascript stuff -->
    </body>
    </html>
    
template_fragment.html:  

    <h1>Hello World</h1>

## Configuration ##

So far there is only one setting:

### OCTOPUS_ALLOW_MANUAL ###

The determines whether hard-coded links may be passed to the template tag

**Default**: `True`

## Todo ##

 * Write some tests for AjaxResponseMixin
 
 * Decorator for FBVs
 
 * Make the determining factor the the template stricter so it's more than just 
 AJAX or not
 
 * Allow user more control over prepend, append, and replace behaviors: speed, 
  effects, etc.
  
 * Allow settings to be set per view rather than globally
 
 * Add compatibility with django-media-helper
